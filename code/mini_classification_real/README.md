# This directory contains all the classifiers and results for smaller original train set.

Approaches we tried:

* `Initial Classification` - trained only on **72** images from original dataset (18 per class).
* `1st mini` - 144 real images for training.
* `2nd mini` - 216 real images for training.
* `3rd mini` - 360 real images for training.
* `4th mini` - 720 real images for training.

\
Test set is constant across all above classifiers. Contains only pre-processed original data.
